# 🎯 Python Design Patterns — Educational Examples

This repository contains **simple, well-commented examples** of classic *Object-Oriented Design Patterns* implemented in Python.
Each pattern demonstrates how developers solved common software design problems —
first *before* the pattern existed, and then using the *pattern approach*.

## 🚀 How to Run

Each file can be executed directly:

```bash
python3 factory_method_basic.py
python3 observer_before.py
python3 singleton_pattern.py
```

Each example includes its own **comments**, **output**, and **short history**
for easy understanding without any additional setup.

## 🧱 Educational Approach

Every pattern pair follows this format:

* **Before Version:** shows the repetitive or rigid code used before the pattern.
* **Pattern Version:** shows the structured, reusable solution.
* **Commented Code:** clear, consistent style for all files.
* **Example Output:** visible directly inside the script.

> **Note:**
> All files are stored in a single folder for simplicity.
> Classification (Creational, Structural, Behavioral) is shown separately
> in the [Patterns Overview](patterns_overview.md) file.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These code examples are **simplified educational demonstrations** meant for learning purposes.
They are **not production-ready** implementations and should not be used without
proper error handling, testing, and optimization.
