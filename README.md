# Python Learning Reference

A compact personal repository containing everything I learn about Python — clean examples, explanations, and reusable code.

---

## Structure

### basics/

* core syntax: variables, data types, operators, collections
* control flow: conditions, loops, functions, files
* quick-reference docs inside `basics/docs/`

### builtins/

* focused lessons on essential functions like `len`, `lambda`, comprehensions
* explains protocols (`__len__`, iteration) and common pitfalls
* roadmap for future lessons (`range`, `enumerate`, `zip`, etc.)

### decorators/

* basics and how `@` works
* best practices and `functools.wraps`
* decorators with arguments
* real examples: logging, timing, retry, caching

### exceptions/

* defensive error handling patterns
* `try`/`except` structure, custom rules, and anti-patterns

### oop/

* classes and objects
* inheritance and composition
* dunder methods
* classmethod, staticmethod, property

### sequences/

* deeper dives into list/tuple behavior not covered in basics
* slicing tricks, negative indexing, thinking in offsets

## Goal

Provide a short, organized reference to quickly review Python concepts and reuse patterns in real projects.

---

## Use

All files are self-contained and runnable.
Open, read, run.
