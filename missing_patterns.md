## 🧱 Why You See This Page

Some patterns listed in the `patterns_overview.md` file have **not been created yet**.
Instead of a broken link or GitHub 404 page, you are redirected here.

This means:

* the pattern is **planned**, but
* the example has **not been implemented yet**.

The missing pattern will be added together with:

* its **Before Version** (old manual way),
* the **Pattern Version** (final structured solution),
* full **comments**,
* **example output**,
* and a short **history**.

Patterns planned for addition include:

* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Bridge
* Composite
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Proxy
* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Interpreter
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* State
* Template Method
* Visitor

(And any missing “before” versions as well!)
